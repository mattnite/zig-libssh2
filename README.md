## How to use

This repo contains code for your `build.zig` that can statically compile libssh2.

### Link to your application

In order to statically link libssh2 into your application:

```zig
const libssh2 = @import("path/to/libssh2.zig");

pub fn build(b: *std.build.Builder) void {
    // ...

    const lib = libssh2.create(b, target, optimize);

    const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
        .name = "my-program",
        .root_source_file = .{ .path = "src/main.zig" },
    });
    lib.link(exe);
}
```
